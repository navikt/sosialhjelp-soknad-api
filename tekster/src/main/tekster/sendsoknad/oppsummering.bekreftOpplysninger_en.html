<p>I am aware that if the information I have given is not correct or information is lacking I can loose the right to benefits. I am also aware that I must pay back what I have wrongly received, and that I can be reported to the police. Furthermore I am aware and accept that NAV can obtain information which is necessary to consider the application.</p>
